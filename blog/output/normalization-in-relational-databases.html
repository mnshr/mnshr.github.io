<ul>
<li><strong>Normalizing data</strong> </li>
<li>a concept by Ted Codd, (relational db creator + entity relationship modeling)</li>
<li>With normalization all the entities end up as individual objects that ensures that we have a well designed db</li>
<li>With no data, we can't normalize | with too much data it is difficult to normalize as data has to be reorganized and change structure<ul>
<li>We should have a sample of the data that is representative to help us normalize</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Normalization terms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entity a group of individual records, identified by primary key (single/multiple columns composite key)<ul>
<li>Candidate keys are evaluated to create the PK</li>
<li>There might be more than 1 unique keys, normalization should work with both, surrogate key &amp; pk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dependency something which could be derived, given another attribute like a pk can be used to derive name, hence name is a dependency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Denormalization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a normalized system, we have multiple tables each representing an entity</li>
<li>We could also combine all the tables to fewer so that when we query we have fewer joins and run faster queries</li>
<li>This could lead to redundancy, since many columns could be duplicated across tables and a single update will be propogated to multiple tables</li>
<li>Normalization is usually done in transactional systems where there are lots of inserts/updates/deletes</li>
<li>Denormalization is mostly done for querying/analytical data warehouse systems for efficient querying (having lots of duplication but fast querying)</li>
<li>Duplication happens with a Central Fact table and multiple dimensional tables which have extra details (star schema)</li>
<li>Data that is fed to normalization process is called Un-normalized (different than denormalized)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Levels of Normalization</h1>
<h2>Common normalization forms (1st, 2nd, 3rd)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every attribute must provide a fact about a key, the whole key and nothing but the key</li>
<li>1st normal no repeating groups/columns e.g. multiple phone numbers must not be different columns</li>
<li>2nd normal non key columns shouldn't be dependent on part of the primary key (must be checked if we have a composite primary key)<ul>
<li>We shouldn't be able to derive info about other columns from just 1 column of the composite pk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3rd normal info should be discoverable only through the key (directly, or indirectly through a foreign key)</li>
<li>BCNF boyce codd normal form normalization should be able to work with surrogate/candidate key and same rules can be applied using the surrogate key (i.e. even if it isn't the formal primary key)</li>
<li>4th normal multi-valued dependencies</li>
<li>5th normal try to decompose the data as much as possible without any data loss</li>
<li>6th normal and so on, but most db designs look upto 3NF </li>
</ul>
<h1>Overnormalization</h1>
<ul>
<li>It may be sometimes good to not follow the rules exactly</li>
<li>Choice between having a complete table for the entity or just a couple of columns <ul>
<li>e.g. address table for every country, state, city, zip code OR just zip code is enough </li>
<li>For a customer data spread across the world it is better to create an address table, for just our business office addresses (which are limited) perfect normalization may not be a good idea</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
